# Manufacturing Defect Analysis using Lean Six Sigma (DMAIC)

This project applies the **DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)** methodology to identify and reduce manufacturing defects using real-world data.

##  Project Objective

Analyze historical defect data to find:
- Most frequent defect types
- Highest cost contributors
- Improvement opportunities

##  Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Lean Six Sigma Framework

##  Key Visuals

- Pareto Charts for Defects
- Cost Trend Over Time
- Monthly KPI Tracking


##  Files

- `Manufacturing Defect Analysis using Lean Six Sigma (DMAIC).ipynb` — Main notebook
- `defects_data.csv` — Raw dataset


##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/manufacturing-defect-analysis-dmaic.git

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code

3. Run all cells
